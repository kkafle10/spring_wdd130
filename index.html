        <p>Hello everyone!</p>

        <p>My name is Kaushal. I am from Kathmandu, Nepal. Currently, my family lives in Portland, OR (PNW: Best part of the USA I would say) and that's where I am once the semesters are done. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I have narrowed down my career path to either becoming a software engineer or a computer analyst.

        I am a huge soccer fan. I like playing, watching or just talking about soccer anytime, anywhere. I support and closely follow F.C. Barcelona. Other than soccer, I like traveling, trying new cuisine and indulging in photography when I am free. I have enjoyed my time at BYU-Idaho immensely till now and there are some great things I love about the school. I have met some of nicest people in my life here, the teachers are really helpful, caring and there are many outdoor activities to do around the city.

        I am taking this class as a part of my major as well as to learn a new language. My goal for this class is to learn the skills required to make web pages as much as possible and apply them to the website that I am planning to make for myself in the near future. Also, HTML and CSS are two of the most seeked langauges in the job industry, so it is to my benefit to learn as much as possible from this class.

        I became a member of the church on December 7, 2018 so I am pretty new to the church. My favorite talk is from Elder Bednar called "Clean Hands and a Pure Heart". I came across this talk for one of my classes and loved the insights I gained.
